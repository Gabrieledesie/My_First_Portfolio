  <h2>About This Project</h2>
  <h3>Why I’m Learning HTML</h3>

  <p>This is my first ever webpage, built entirely with HTML.</p>
  <p>I’m learning HTML to build and design amazing websites from scratch.</p>
  <p>This project is helping me understand how web content is structured.</p>
  <p>In the future, I plan to use CSS and JavaScript to style and make it interactive.</p>
